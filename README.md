# Clinical-System-Predicting-Breast-cancer(MVC architecture & using WPF & ORM)
The main objective of this project is to develop a small application with a graphical user interface that will allow us to use the machine learning algorithm. To achieve this objective, we have the following specific goals:

Create a window with different tabs that each of them has specific functionality such as a login interface for doctors, a window to create a new doctor's profile, a main window containing various functionalities, and a window to create and modify a patient's profile. Use the MVC software architecture model to ensure that the application is efficient and user-friendly. Establish communication with a database using Entity Framework Core. Use KnnLibrary to implement the k-NN algorithm and measure the model's performance. Ensure that the application is user-friendly and that the different components are properly arranged and validated. By achieving these objectives, we will develop a small application that will allow us to use the machine learning algorithm developed in the context of the second practical work. The application will be efficient, easy to use, and user-friendly. Furthermore, we will demonstrate our ability to use different technologies and design patterns to develop software applications with a graphical user interface.
